/** Grants breeding capabilities to the mob.
Recommended combination with cBehaviorItemFollower.

Connections to other behaviors:
- If the mob also has cBehaviorPet, this behavior is suppressed unless the mob has an owner.

Special connections:
- Relies on the polymorphic cMonster::GetBreedingItems function to determine the breeding items.
